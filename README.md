# portfolio Rik Verhoeven
Hello my name is Rik Verhoeven,
currently I am studying software engineering at Codam(started in July 2023).
Also I am enrolled into part-time mechanical engineering study, this I started in July 2022.
During this time I also worked as a allround welder for 4 months and 1 month as a mechanic.


Next to my study I like to tinker on hobby projects, 

This portfolio shows the projects I worked on during for the study and also the hobby projects.


At Codam/42 curriculum we mainly learn by doing practical coding projects, I got to code a Shell in C based on bash, a mini Raytracer and more.


## What I'm up to
💻 I am working my way through the core curriculum in Codam, currently working on a webserver and ray tracer from scratch in C/C++.  
🏆 I am almost always working on at least one side project to broaden my skillset. Most recently, I worked on setting up a robust, anonymous voting system for the student council, and on moving my infrastructure from plain Docker/Caprover to Kubernetes.  
🔍 I am looking for part-time work! Backend and systems programming are my forte, but I'm a fast learner.

## What I've done
🤝 I have been on the Codam Student Council for a year.  
📚️ Before Codam, I studied law, with a focus on administrative and European law. Public administration remains an interest of mine.    
💎 I built __[Dotagem](https://github.com/dotagem/dotagem)__, a Telegram bot that allows users to link their Steam and Telegram accounts together, letting them display Dota 2 match and profile data in any chat.  
🛠️ In the 42 curriculum, I have built my own [2D game](https://github.com/cschuijt42/so_long) and a [shell](https://github.com/cschuijt42/minishell), all from scratch.
