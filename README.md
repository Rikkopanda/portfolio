# portfolio Rik Verhoeven

## Introduction

Hello my name is Rik Verhoeven,
currently I am studying software engineering at Codam(started in July 2023).
Also I am enrolled into part-time mechanical engineering study at Avans hogeschool, this I started in July 2022.
During this time I also worked as a allround welder for 4 months and 1 month as a mechanic.
Before these studies I went to civil construction college(Bouwkunde MBO BOL4).

The Codam curriculum contains practical coding projects; such as a [shell](https://github.com/Rikkopanda/minishell) in C based on bash, a mini [raytracer](https://github.com/Rikkopanda/Mini_RT) written from scatch, a [wireframe](https://github.com/Rikkopanda/FDF) builer and more.
Next to my study I like to work on projects, for instance I made a diy [cnc](https://github.com/Rikkopanda/portfolio/blob/main/diy_cnc/README.md) and a small robot arm made out of mdf(wood).
Also I like to practice with electronics.

This portfolio shows the projects I worked on during the study and also a couple hobby projects.
