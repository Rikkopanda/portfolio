# portfolio Rik Verhoeven
Hello my name is Rik Verhoeven,
currently I am studying software engineering at Codam(started in July 2023).
Also I am enrolled into part-time mechanical engineering study, this I started in July 2022.
During this time I also worked as a allround welder for 4 months and 1 month as a mechanic.


Next to my study I like to tinker on hobby projects, 

This portfolio shows the projects I worked on during for the study and also the hobby projects.


At Codam/42 curriculum we mainly learn by doing practical coding projects, I got to code a Shell in C based on bash, a mini Raytracer and more.
