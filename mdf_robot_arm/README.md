This robot arm made out of wood 4mm mdf.
At the local makerspace in Breda there was a lasercutter available,
lasercutting the wood is a fast process.
The material turned out to be a bit too flexible and sometimes the gears are not meshing properly.

The robot is driven by nema 17's connected to worm gears.
One in the base which rotates the whole robot and two driving the 4 bar linkage.

On the software side is a small .net windows app, which sends commands via serial COM to the Arduino.
