Diy CNC project.

This project I started in 2022 and was originally intended for milling and engraving wood for furniture projects, it ended up being capable of milling alluminium at decent speeds.

After collecting dust for a year it is now being repurposed for grinding glass plates, my father made some additional adjustments to facilitate this.
