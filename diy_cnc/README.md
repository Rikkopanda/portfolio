##Diy CNC project.

This project I started in 2022 and was originally intended for milling and engraving wood for furniture projects, it ended up being capable of milling alluminium at decent speeds. Steel however not.

After collecting dust for a year it is now being repurposed for grinding glass plates, my father made some additional adjustments to facilitate this.
